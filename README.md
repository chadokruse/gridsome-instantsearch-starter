## Gridsome InstantSearch - Boilerplate

This is a bare-bones starter template for folks interested in exploring [Algolia Vue-InstantSearch](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/vue/) with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/).

It's what you'd get if you ran `gridsome create new-project`, but with Vue-InstantSearch pre-installed in all the right places.

The template uses the InstantSearch [satellite theme](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/instantsearch.css@latest/themes/) as a basic starter.
